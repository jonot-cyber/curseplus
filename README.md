# Curse+
Makes items with Curse of Binding never break.

This is a simple minecraft mod for fabric 1.19.2 that makes it so items with Curse of Binding never break.

## Rationale
I feel like the ability to just step on a sweet berry bush and break a Curse of Binding item is cheating. Curse of Binding should be an actual curse, not just an inconvenience.
